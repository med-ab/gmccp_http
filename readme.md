Checkpoint Objective
---------------
In this checkpoint, you will be performing a series of guided instructions to create a REST API by manipulating your database with mongoose.
- PS: don't forget to comment on your code before submitting it.

Instructions
----------
1. Start a new Node JS project  with ‘ npm init ‘
2. Install the mongoose and express and  .env
3. Configure the environment variables with .env
4. Lunch a server with express in the server.js file
5. Connect your database locally or with mongo atlas
6. The Folder structure should be like this :
  - config/.env 
  - server.js
7. Create a models folder and a User.js file in it 
8. In User.js you must define a mongoose Schema and export the model , will use it in the server.js
9. The Folder structure should be like this : 
  - config/ .env 
  - models/User.js
  - server.js
10. In the server.js create four routes : 
  - GET :  RETURN ALL USERS 
  - POST :  ADD A NEW USER TO THE DATABASE 
  - PUT : EDIT A USER BY ID 
  - DELETE : REMOVE A USER BY ID  
**NB**: in each callback function you will use mongoose methods to manipulate your data and return it in the response 
11. Use postman to test each route.
